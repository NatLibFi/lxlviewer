# LXL Viewer

## Requirements

Requires the following to be installed on the host machine:

* [Python 2.7+](http://python.org/)
* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) (commonly installed along with Python on modern distros)

(It is recommended to create a virtualenv for hosting self-contained Python
environments)

Run:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

## Runtime Dependencies

Requires a PostgreSQL instance containing a DB setup based on the needs of the
external module `lxltools.lddb`. To run that locally, you'll need:

* [PostgreSQL 9.4+](http://www.postgresql.org/) (you need the JSON support of 9.4 or greater)

## Building

Initially and whenever the repo is updated, build the web assets:

    $ (cd viewer && npm install)

## Running

Just call:

    $ python serve.py

And go to <http://localhost:5000/>

If you want to change settings for database access or Flask, create a config
file and edit to your liking (e.g. add `DEBUG = True`):

    $ cp instance/config.cfg.in instance/config.cfg


## Managing CSS and JS Resources

Requires an installation of [Node](http://nodejs.org/) (including
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)).

Go to the viewer subdirectory:

    $ cd viewer/

Initial setup:

    $ npm install

During development:

    $ npm run watch

Separately building app files:

    $ npm run app

Updating vendor dependencies:

    $ npm run vendor

## Linting

    $ npm run app:eslint

  Or just lint with your plugin of choice, as long as it uses the config defined in ``.eslintrc``.

  Make sure to activate linting of ``.html`` files so that eslint will lint your ``.vue`` files.

  Read more about the eslint-config at [airbnb/javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
